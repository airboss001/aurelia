  Before you can build an application with Aurelia, you need to meet a couple of
  prerequisites.

# Quick install guide

## Install Node.js

To create new Aurelia applications using the Aurelia CLI via Makes, you will need to ensure you have Node.js installed. The latest version of Node is always recommended and preferable. While Node can be installed through different methods, the easiest is to obtain a distributable from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Create an app

Aurelia does not require you to install any global Node packages, instead by using the [Makes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/makes) scaffolding tool, new Aurelia applications can be generated by running the following command.

```bash
npx makes aurelia
```

You will then be presented with the Aurelia CLI screen which will first ask for a project name, then guide you through some options. The fastest way to get started is by choosing either the ESNext or TypeScript default options \(1 and 2\).

## Run the app

Once the CLI process is finished and you have installed the dependencies for your new app, run `npm start` in the project directory, a browser window will open up with the new Aurelia application you just generated running.
